# Antisocial behaviour datasets for data science

## Introduction
This project was created to show basic analysis of public datasets of **antisocial behaviour**. Main idea is to make each analysis replicable, so everyone can add his own analysis and use it for his experiments and data mining. Every dataset has his own *python jupyter notebook* with simple analysis, which can help to choose correct dataset for data mining.
